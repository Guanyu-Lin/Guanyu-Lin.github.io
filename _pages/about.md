Hi, I am from Carnegie Mellon University. Before that, I graduated from Tsinghua University. I have broad research interests in data mining and machine learning, especially their large-scale applications. Specifically, I am interested in developing more advanced machine learning and deep learning methods for information retrieval and large-scale distributed systems, from optimization and architecture perspectives. The methods I used to develop enable information retrieval systems to provide personalized service for over 60,000,000 users. I serve as the PC member for TOIS, AAAI. I used to participate in ACM-ICPC, which is a distant memory now.
